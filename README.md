Basic timer for timing speakers see [speakeasy.dkcy.com](http://speakeasy.dkcy.com)

Inspired by [http://arementalkingtoomuch.com/](http://arementalkingtoomuch.com/) and [tweet by Dr Prachi Srivastava](https://twitter.com/PrachiSrivas/status/1008808589379690496). In retrospect, should have just built on [Cathy Deng's code](https://github.com/cathydeng/are-men-talking-too-much), but I wanted to mess around with React and Material Design.

6 timers, each with customisable labels.

That's it. Click a timer and it starts, click it again and it stops. Click another timer and that starts, but pauses all the others.
Possible future features:
1) Clear function to clear all timers - simple, but haven't done it
2) Saving labels and timings (at the mo, you could just screenshot it)
3) Set timers up in an array and provide option to choose number of timers.
4) UX improvements.
